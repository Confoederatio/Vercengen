### Abstract.

Vercengen is an imperative frontend software engine developed for Universal Framework with a focus on rapid application development and UI/UX as a function of state. It is used as the main frontend for most Confoederatio applications and provides simple adjustable CSS themes by tinkering with variables (see documentation).

Vercengen supports file explorers, nested hierarchies, delta action undo/redo trees, searchable lists, sortable lists, WYSIWYG editors, recursive context menus and tooltips, window management, and much more. For a list of all available components, please reference the documentation [here](https://confoederatiodocs.info/en/CTD/Verkengen).
